# ALIENS-R-REAL

## Background

<img align="left" width="200" height='200' src="images/ufo.svg" alt="ufo">
The extra-terrestrial have come to Earth and we have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! We have put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

Our collection is too large to search through manually. We created a web page only using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values.

The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!
